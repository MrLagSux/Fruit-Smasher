TODO-LIST:
Necessary Features:
  - Balancing
  -> Please introduce real enemies and balance their stats so that they become useful
  -> Player dies in like 4 rounds, too hard

  - Spawners
  -> Entities that spawn Enemies, for more fun that doesn't end in 3 rounds
  -> Shouldn't be too hard to fight, but also not too easy
  -> Kinda necessary to advance, but not mandatory

  - Add Saving/Loading
  -> What to save... What to load? Enemies? Map? map_played.png?
  -> Save/Load Buttons in Options, perhaps even Export/Import?

  - Quests and Tutorials
  -> Give the player something to do

  - Chest Drops
  -> Enemies should drop Chests, which drop Items

  - Finally make Items useful
  -> Drops from Chests, boost to all kind of stats
  -> Set Bonus?

Free time? Do this:
  - Work on more Maps
  -> Having 1 or 2 extra maps to try different zones wouldn't be bad
  -> Flower types to make the map less boring

  - Draw Item images D:
  -> It has to be done at some point

Nice to have / QoL:
  - Add the Music
  -> Once done, add a Mute Button to Options

  - Advanced Stat Breakdown
  -> Display what Stats are made of
